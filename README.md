# R for Data Science
This repo stores my R practice work from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) book.
Here is the link to the [Solutions Manaul](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/).

Another resourse is a website that teaches [Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/).
[Mastering R Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) is another helpful book.
